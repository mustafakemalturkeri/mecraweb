The DMP covered monitoring, preparedness, early warning, response, and long-term recovery strategies.<br><br>Designed a basin-scale action plan, prioritizing ecosystem resilience, water-use efficiency, and institutional readiness. Recommended demand-side and supply-side interventions for drought-prone subbasins.<br><br>Developed drought susceptibility maps using GIS and remote sensing, identifying high-risk areas and spatially targeting conservation and emergency response measures.<br><br>Built a custom drought monitoring and assessment platform, including both standalone desktop software and a web-based early warning system accessible to basin stakeholders.<br><br>Integrated climate change scenarios into all planning components, identifying long-term risks and adaptation pathways.<br><br>Facilitated multi-stakeholder engagement, organizing public authority briefings, local workshops, and cross-sectoral consultations to ensure participatory planning.<br><br>Drafted all strategic and technical reports, including the final DMP, stakeholder consultation reports, GIS outputs, and implementation guidelines in full compliance with national standards and contractual obligations.<br><br>This pioneering plan established a replicable model for drought governance in climate-stressed basins and continues to inform TÃ¼rkiyeâ€™s national drought policy framework."
